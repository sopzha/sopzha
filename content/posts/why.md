In this post, I outline the reasons I am starting this blog.

1. **Become a stronger writer.**

My education at MIT has benefited me in many ways. Improving my writing and
communication skills is not one of them. After completing the required
writing-intensive classes, I found no incentive to continue pursuing related
humanities classes at a technical institution as a computer science major.
Combined with my regular use of ChatGPT this past year to complete my written
assignments, I've noticed a considerable decline in my ability to express myself
in English, both orally and in writing.

I don't blame MIT for an incomplete education. My discomfort with writing is
largely due to my own lack of commitment to practice. Recently, however, I've
felt a stronger urge to become a better writer. Not only will writing help me in
my professional career and personal correspondences, I find it self-satisfying
to be able to procure just the right word or phrase to capture a particular
feeling.

This blog is an attempt for me to address this problem. I hope through
regularly blogging, I'm able to express my ideas in a way that is both
understandable and reflective of a voice that is uniquely my own.

2. **Reinforce my learnings.**

My second motivation for beginning this blog is to reinforce my understanding
of challenging topics. I have found through my classes that concepts in
computer science only begin to make sense after I've implemented the algorithm
in code. Not everything is easily represented as code, but generally anything
can be written about (otherwise, how can it be taught?). In the way coding
has allowed me to solidify theoretical ideas into a more palpable form, I hope
writing will similarly provide a mechanism for me to synthesize what I learn,
both within and outside the realm of computer science.

There are other benefits to starting a blog: provide an accessible learning
resource for readers, build online credibility, make money, etc. I would love
to be rewarded with every benefit that comes with blogging. But the two above
are my primary reasons for blogging and likely the two of which I will remind
myself when I inevitably lose motivation to maintain this blog.
