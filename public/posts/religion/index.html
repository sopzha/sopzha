  <section><p>A few weeks ago, I had a conversation with a friend about faith. She is
Christian; I am not.</p>
<p>I told her that being Christian is inconvenient for me. My social circles are
not predominantly Christian, and there are ideas in the Bible &ndash; like treating
homosexuality as a sin &ndash; that I simply don&rsquo;t feel comfortable adopting as my
own.</p>
<p>She seemed dismayed. <em>How can you live your life without structure and rules?
What&rsquo;s stopping you from committing murder? If we all simply believe what&rsquo;s
convenient, the world will be utter chaos.</em></p>
<p>First of all, if the only thing stopping someone from committing murder is
a book (albeit a pretty good one), they likely have some moral deficiency. I
would argue that even in a lawless society where murder is not a crime, the
number of murders wouldn&rsquo;t increase significantly compared to today. Most
people who would commit murder if were legal would still do so when it&rsquo;s
illegal. I have faith that most people &mdash; Christian or not &mdash; have a moral
compass that transcends the law or any set of explicit religious rules, which
allows society to maintain relative order. While Christians may root our
inherent morality in an external being called God, I don&rsquo;t think it necessary
to do so in order to recognize that we have morals.</p>
<p>Secondly, I think we&rsquo;re understating the impact of convenience, even among
Christians. It is convenient for my friend to be Christian; she grew
up in a Christian household and is surrounded by Christian friends every day.
It&rsquo;s also convenient that Christianity is an attractive religion &mdash; it
guarantees
its believers an unconditionally loving father and the possibility of eternal
life after death. Had Christianity been founded on a system of regularly
subjecting oneself to pain, I doubt it would&rsquo;ve stuck around for so long. In
fact, I&rsquo;d argue my friend encountered Christianity in large part due to
convenience.</p>
<p>I believe that not only do we already believe what&rsquo;s convenient, but we should
continue to do so. If we suffer a loss and need an emotional anchor, why not
pray to God? If we happen to be gay, why adopt a faith that identifies us
as sinners? There&rsquo;s already so much in life we can&rsquo;t control; the least we can
do for ourselves is to believe in something that makes life suck less.</p>
<p>One group that may benefit from adopting some established religion is
the small subset of people who would only commit murder in a lawless society.
Even if their moral compass is misaligned, they can keep their impulses in
check through external forces, like laws. If those laws took the form of a
religious text, that religion could supplant their instinctive &ldquo;morals&rdquo; (or
lack thereof) and help them lead lives that benefit society. Here, I
define good morals as principles that contribute to maintaining societal order.</p>
<p>I appreciate that my Christian friends openly discuss their faith and share
their beliefs
with non-Christians &mdash; not because I think everyone should be
Christian, but because it&rsquo;s helpful to understand our options. As people like
myself are exploring what belief systems
work for us, we can adopt an existing religion fully, take bits and pieces from
multiple ones, or reject them entirely, depending on our unique experiences and
needs.</p>
<p>One might think that the freedom I propose in choosing our
beliefs undermines the validity of any religion. But I wonder if validity
is that important. Scientific facts we once held as absolute truths have been
disproven. Yet even in eras when epeople believed the galaxy revolved around
the Earth, they lived perfectly content lives. Justifying your beliefs with
convenience &mdash; whether that means aligning them with scientific evidence or
with personal needs &mdash; seems far more reasonable and less arrogant to me than
claiming your belief is the sole truth.</p>
<p>Nothing is more real than what you choose to believe. Believe in something if you
want. Believe in nothing if you&rsquo;re comfortable with that, too. Share your
belief, but don&rsquo;t expect the same response from everyone.</p>
